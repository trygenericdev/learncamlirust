# Learn Rust by migrating a (very small) part of Camlistore

Camlistore is an awesome project written in [golang](http://golang.org/).
The only bad thing is the documentation, which is ... well ... invisible.
So I started to look into the code to understand how it works.

Roughly, at the same time I started to look into [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/).
And I decided to learn Rust by porting a (very small, really tiny) part of Camlistore.


## FAQ (and their answers)

#### Are you planning to rewrite Camlistore in Rust?

No. I do not have the time, the knowledge or the desire to write nor **maintain**
such part. Camlistore is great as it is.

#### But, why are you doing this?

Because porting an existing program is a great opportunity to learn. Camlistore is 
a very diverse project so it will allow me to try the different aspects of Rust.

#### But, Rust seems to be a great programming language to write Camlistore?

Yes, and so does Go. But this is not the scope of the project.

#### But I would like to have Camlistore in Rust!

Feel free to do it. You are free to take my code and use it as you see it fit. But 
please remember that is written by somebody who is new to Rust. It is very likely
not idiomatic, not safe, not fast, not good and not fun.

#### What parts of Camlistore are you planning to port? 

Not sure yet.

#### Can I contribute with code and suggestions?

Yes! As long as your contribution is more than just code. It would be great if the
Pull Requests are accompanied by a great commit explaining why your modification
improves the code. Remember, it is a learning experience.
